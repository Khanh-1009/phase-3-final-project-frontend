# Phase-3 Final Project Front-End - The SkinWish Cosmetic Website

## Learning Goals

* Create a single page application using create-react-app.
* Implement proper front end state management. Update state using a setState function after receiving your response from a POST, PATCH, or DELETE request.

## Introduction

I would like to create a commercial website for selling cosmetic and skincare products, such as Sephora, Ulta Beauty, or Stylevana. We can find almost every brands and items that are latest and most popular in the market. 

I was inspired by Stylevana's website, and I used several photos from it. There are some websites that provide me great information about beauty business. I truly appreciate these websites below.

## Conclusion

This project is more about the Back-End setup. In the React Front-End app, we would like to focus how to manage complex state, which I didn't have in the phase-2 project.
